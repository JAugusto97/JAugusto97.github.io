I work on automatic content verification (e.g., disinformation detection, analysis of persuasion techniques and credibility signals). My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, large language models (LLMs), explainability, and ethical AI. I am particularly interested in automatic verification of LLM-generated text, and the development of tools to support fact-checkers in their work.
